REFACTOR ASSIGNMENT

Changes Made to HTML and CSS:

  - Replaced the first div section with a proper header element and nav elements within it since this is the navigation area of the webpage.
  - In the main I changed the content section element to section instead of div and also changed the elements inside to articles rather than div to follow proper semantic structure.
  - Placed each article into the same class labeled "content" rather than having seperate classes for each article. This made for more logical CSS rather 
  than having 3 seperate classes all with the same properties and values. 
  -Did the same for each article in the benefits section. Created a class labeled "benefits" to group these articles into 1 rather than 3 seperate containers. 
  - Added alt text to each image that is on the webpage for accessibility reasons.
  - Gave the webpage a nice fitting title.
  - Gave the webpage a proper footer rather than using div elements for that as well.
  - Fixed broken link for search-engine-optimization by adding the missing id.
